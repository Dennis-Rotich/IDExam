**tAhIni** is a next-generation "Exam Operating System" designed to replace static LMS forms with a robust, IDE-grade assessment environment.

This repository houses the **IDExam Engine**—the frontend interface that provides students with a VS Code-like experience, real-time cloud synchronization, and "Black Box" execution feedback.

## Key Features

* **IDE-Grade Editor:** Fully integrated **Monaco Editor** (VS Code core) with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and minimap support.
* **The Sync Engine:** A custom "Invisible Hand" hook (`useAutoSave`) that debounces user keystrokes (1000ms) to prevent API flooding while ensuring zero data loss.
* **Resizable Architecture:** Built with `react-resizable-panels`, allowing users to customize their workspace (Question vs. Editor vs. Console) just like a real IDE.
* **"Alive" Loading States:** Replaces boring spinners with **Shimmer/Pulse Skeletons**, maintaining layout stability during data hydration.
* **Student Console:** A dedicated "Black Box" terminal that sanitizes execution output—showing pass/fail status without revealing hidden test cases.
* **Performance First:** State management via **Zustand** with strict selector subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Architecture

The application follows a strict **unidirectional data flow** to ensure stability during high-stress exams.

### 1. The Brain: `useExamStore` (Zustand)
The single source of truth. It manages:
* **Question Indexing:** Tracks the active question via array index (not object reference) to prevent desync.
* **Code State:** Uses immutable array updates to track student code per question.
* **Save Status:** Tracks `idle | saving | saved | error` states for UI feedback.

### 2. The Nervous System: `useAutoSave` Hook
This hook sits between the Store and the API.
1.  **Listens** for changes in the `code` string.
2.  **Debounces** the input (waits for the user to stop typing for 1s).
3.  **Executes** the API call.
4.  **Updates** the `saveStatus` in the store, which triggers the UI indicator.

### 3. The Skeleton: `LoadingExam`
To prevent layout shifts (CLS), the app calculates the exact geometry of the IDE panels before data arrives, rendering a "Ghost UI" with shimmer effects until the backend responds.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
  Node.js 18+
  npm or pnpm

#### Installation
#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/tahini-frontend.git](https://github.com/yourusername/tahini-frontend.git)
cd tahini-frontend
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Run the development server
```bash
    npm run dev
```

#### 4. Open locally
  Navigate to http://localhost:5173.

### Configuration
#### Customizing the Sync Engine
You can adjust the debounce timer in ``src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts``:
```typescript
// Change the delay (in ms)
const debouncedSave = useCallback(
  debounce((code, id) => saveToBackend(code, id), 1500), // currently 1.5s
  []
);
```

#### Mock Data Mode
Currently, ExamPage.tsx simulates an API fetch. To connect to a real backend, uncomment the fetch logic in the useEffect hook and remove the setTimeout simulation.


### Future Roadmap
  [ ] WebSocket Integration: Replace polling with Socket.io for real-time instructor proctoring.

  [ ] Diff View: Add a "Diff Editor" mode to show students exactly where their output diverged from the expected result.

  [ ] Multi-Language Support: Extend Monaco configuration for Python, C++, and Go.

  [ ] Offline Mode: Implement localStorage fallback if the internet connection drops completely.
